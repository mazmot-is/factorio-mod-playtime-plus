  "description": "Adds a clock saying how long the current game has been running. The time is ingame time (same as given by the /time command), not wall clock time. I.e. if your computer can't keep up and runs only 30 ticks/second (instead of the normal 60/second), then the clock will only show 30 seconds after 1 minute of wall clock time.",
